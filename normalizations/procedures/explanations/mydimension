. .1 mydimension
------------------

*Syntax:*
     `mydimension (' ideal_expression `)'
     

*Type:*
     int

*Purpose:*
     computes the dimension of the ideal, generated by
     the leading monomials of the given generators of the ideal.  
     This is also the dimension of the ideal if it is
     represented by a standard basis.
    

*Note_*
     The dimension of an ideal I means the Krull dimension of the
     basering modulo I. The ring of integers has dimension 1, so 
     Z[x_1,..x_n] has dimension n+1.
     

*Example:*
       LIB "normalint.lib";
       ring r=integer,(x,y,z),dp;
       ideal i=2x3+5xy,13z4,9x3z;
       mydimension(i);
       ==> 2
       ideal ii = i,7;
       mydimension(ii);
       ==> 1
       ring R=0,(x,y,z),dp;
       ideal i=fetch(r,i);
       dim(i);
       ==> 1
    //--- just to compare, the dimension is lower over a field
