# Normalization
Computer Algebra Algorithms for Normalzation of Polynomial Rings over the Integers

## Abstract

Normalization of a reduced Noetherian ring means to compute its integral closure in its total ring of fractions. 
Implementations in the Computer Algebra Language Singular. Research for the Leibniz University Hanover in the context of the SPP-1489, Algorithmic and experimental methods in algebra, geometry, and number theory.
